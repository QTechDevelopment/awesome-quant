## ⚠️ Critical Considerations

### Legal & Compliance ⚖️
**You CANNOT operate as a broker-dealer without registration.**

**Solution:** Partner with a licensed broker like Alpaca Markets
- They handle compliance (SEC, FINRA)
- SIPC insurance for user accounts
- You focus on the app, they handle trades
- Commission-free trading maintained

**Required:**
- KYC verification (Plaid/Onfido)
- AML monitoring
- Pattern day trader rules
- State money transmitter licenses (if handling funds)

### Security 🔒
**Critical requirements:**
- SSL/TLS encryption (HTTPS only)
- JWT authentication with short expiration
- 2FA mandatory for withdrawals
- Rate limiting (prevent abuse)
- SQL injection prevention
- XSS protection
- Regular security audits
- Encrypted database fields (PII)

### Risk Management 🎲
**Must implement:**
- Daily trade limits per user
- Max position sizes
- Pre-trade balance checks
- Circuit breakers (volatility)
- Suspicious activity alerts
- Account freeze capability
