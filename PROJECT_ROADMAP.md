## 🚨 Risk Mitigation

### Critical Path Items
1. **Alpaca API Access** (Week 1)
   - Risk: API approval delays
   - Mitigation: Apply early, have backup (Interactive Brokers)

2. **Real-time Data Costs** (Week 3)
   - Risk: Data costs exceed budget
   - Mitigation: Start with free tier, optimize subscriptions

3. **KYC Approval Time** (Week 7)
   - Risk: Plaid integration issues
   - Mitigation: Manual KYC fallback process

4. **Performance at Scale** (Week 8)
   - Risk: System slowdowns under load
   - Mitigation: Load testing early, horizontal scaling plan

### Backup Plans
- **If behind schedule**: Cut P2 features, focus on P0
- **If budget overruns**: Use cheaper cloud provider, optimize costs
- **If technical blockers**: Hire consultant, use proven libraries
